                <li>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life.</li>
                <li>It has a diameter of about 12,742 km (7,918 miles).</li>
                <li>About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water, and the remaining 29% is land.</li>
                <li>Earth has one moon, known simply as "the Moon."</li>
                <li>It takes Earth 24 hours to complete one rotation, which defines a day.</li>
                <li>It takes Earth about 365.25 days to orbit the Sun, which defines a year.</li>
                <li>Earth's atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%).</li>
                <li>Earth's surface is divided into several tectonic plates that move over time.</li>
                <li>The planet has a diverse range of climates, from tropical to polar regions.</li>
                <li>Earth has a magnetic field that protects it from solar radiation.</li>
                <li>Earthâ€™s atmosphere allows it to maintain temperatures that can support liquid water.</li>
                <li>Earth has seasons due to the tilt of its axis relative to its orbital plane.</li>
                <li>Earth's biosphere has significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic conditions.</li>
                <li>The planet has more than 8 million species of plants and animals.</li>
                <li>Earth's surface is mostly covered by oceans, which play a key role in regulating its climate.</li>
                <li>The tallest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest, reaching a height of 8,848 meters (29,029 feet).</li>
                <li>The deepest oceanic trench is the Mariana Trench, which reaches a depth of about 11 kilometers (7 miles).</li>
                <li>Earth's internal structure is divided into a solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a mantle, and a crust.</li>
                <li>Earth's climate has changed significantly over geological time, influencing the evolution of life.</li>
                <li>Human activity has a significant impact on Earth's ecosystems and climate.</li>
