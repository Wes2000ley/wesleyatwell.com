            <ul class="facts-list">
                <li>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.</li>
                <li>It has a diameter of about 139,820 km (86,881 miles), making it more than 11 times wider than Earth.</li>
                <li>Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to the Sun.</li>
                <li>It has a strong magnetic field, with a magnetosphere extending millions of kilometers into space.</li>
                <li>Jupiter has a fast rotation, completing a day in about 9.9 hours.</li>
                <li>Its iconic Great Red Spot is a massive storm larger than Earth, lasting for centuries.</li>
                <li>Jupiter has at least 79 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.</li>
                <li>It has faint rings composed of dust particles.</li>
                <li>Jupiter has been visited by spacecraft such as Voyager 1 and 2, Galileo, Juno, and the upcoming Europa Clipper mission.</li>
                <li>The planet's atmosphere features bands of clouds, with the upper atmosphere marked by colorful zones and belts.</li>
                <li>Jupiter experiences intense radiation and powerful storms, including lightning and auroras near its poles.</li>
                <li>It plays a critical role in shaping the Solar System's dynamics, influencing the orbits of other planets and asteroids.</li>
                <li>Jupiter's mass is more than 300 times that of Earth, dominating the gravitational balance in the outer Solar System.</li>
                <li>The planet's immense gravity acts as a shield, deflecting many comets and asteroids away from inner planets like Earth.</li>
                <li>Future missions aim to explore Jupiter's moons for signs of habitability and understand its complex magnetic environment.</li>
