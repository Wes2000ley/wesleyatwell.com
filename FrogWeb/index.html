            <ul>
                <li>Frogs are amphibians, which means they can live both in water and on land.</li>
                <li>There are over 6,000 species of frogs worldwide, found on every continent except Antarctica.</li>
                <li>The smallest frog is the Paedophryne amauensis, which measures only about 7.7 mm in length.</li>
