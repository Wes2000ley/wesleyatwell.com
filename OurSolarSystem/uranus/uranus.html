            <ul class="facts-list">
                <li>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third-largest in the Solar System.</li>
                <li>It is often referred to as an "ice giant," composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with a small rocky core.</li>
                <li>Uranus has a diameter of about 50,724 km (31,518 miles).</li>
                <li>Its atmosphere contains hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives Uranus its blue-green color.</li>
                <li>Uranus rotates on its side, with its axis tilted at an angle of 98 degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun.</li>
                <li>Due to its extreme axial tilt, Uranus experiences extreme seasonal variations during its 84-year orbit.</li>
                <li>It has a ring system, which was discovered in 1977, consisting of dark narrow rings made of dust particles and small rocks.</li>
                <li>Uranus has 27 known moons, with the largest being Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.</li>
                <li>It has a faint and variable ring system, different from the more prominent rings of Saturn.</li>
                <li>Uranus has a magnetic field tilted at an angle of about 60 degrees from its axis of rotation.</li>
                <li>It was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel and was the first planet discovered with a telescope.</li>
                <li>Uranus' temperature can drop to -224°C (-371°F) due to its distance from the Sun.</li>
                <li>Uranus has been visited only once by a spacecraft, Voyager 2, in 1986, providing valuable data about the planet and its moons.</li>
                <li>The planet's rotational period is about 17 hours and 14 minutes.</li>
                <li>Uranus' atmosphere contains traces of water, ammonia, and methane, which gives it its distinctive blue-green hue.</li>
                <li>Future missions may explore Uranus to learn more about its composition, atmosphere, and unique magnetic environment.</li>
                <li>Uranus is visible to the naked eye but appears as a faint blue-green disk due to its distance and dimness.</li>
                <li>Its moons show signs of geological activity, including cryovolcanism and surface features shaped by impacts and tidal forces.</li>
