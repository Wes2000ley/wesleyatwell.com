            <h2>The Sun Facts</h2>
            <ul class="facts-list">
                <li>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.</li>
                <li>It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, mainly composed of hydrogen (about 74% of its mass) and helium (about 24%).</li>
                <li>The Sun's diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), making it about 109 times the diameter of Earth.</li>
                <li>It has a surface temperature of about 5,500째C (9,932째F) and a core temperature of about 15 million 째C (27 million 째F).</li>
                <li>The Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion, where hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium, releasing vast amounts of energy.</li>
                <li>It has a complex magnetic field that drives solar activity such as sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections.</li>
                <li>The Sun's energy supports life on Earth and drives Earth's climate and weather patterns.</li>
                <li>Solar radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet radiation, and heat, emanates from the Sun in all directions.</li>
                <li>The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and is roughly halfway through its life cycle as a main-sequence star.</li>
                <li>It orbits the center of the Milky Way galaxy, taking about 225-250 million years to complete one orbit (galactic year).</li>
                <li>The Sun's mass accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.</li>
                <li>Solar eclipses occur when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking out its light partially or entirely.</li>
                <li>The Sun's luminosity gradually increases over time as it continues to burn hydrogen in its core.</li>
                <li>NASA and other space agencies study the Sun using satellites like the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Parker Solar Probe.</li>
                <li>The Sun's surface exhibits granulation, sunspots, and solar prominences, visible during solar observations.</li>
                <li>Future missions aim to study the Sun's outer atmosphere (corona) and its effects on space weather.</li>
                <li>Solar flares and coronal mass ejections can impact Earth's magnetic field and technological systems, causing geomagnetic storms.</li>
                <li>The Sun's energy output varies over an 11-year solar cycle, affecting space weather and Earth's climate.</li>
                <li>Scientists study the Sun to understand stellar evolution, the origin of the Solar System, and the habitability of other planets.</li>
                <li>The Sun is essential for photosynthesis in plants and provides the primary source of energy for most ecosystems on Earth.</li>
