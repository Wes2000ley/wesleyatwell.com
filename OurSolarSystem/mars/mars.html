            <ul class="facts-list">
                <li>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often referred to as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance.</li>
                <li>It has a diameter of about 6,779 km (4,212 miles).</li>
                <li>Mars has two small moons named Phobos and Deimos.</li>
                <li>The planet's thin atmosphere is primarily composed of carbon dioxide (95%), with traces of nitrogen and argon.</li>
                <li>Mars experiences seasons similar to Earth due to the tilt of its rotational axis.</li>
                <li>A day on Mars, known as a "sol," is slightly longer than a day on Earth, lasting about 24.6 hours.</li>
                <li>It takes Mars about 687 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun.</li>
                <li>Mars is home to the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which stands about 22 km (13.6 miles) high.</li>
                <li>The planet's surface is marked by vast canyons, including Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyon systems in the solar system.</li>
                <li>Mars has evidence of past water flows in the form of dry riverbeds and minerals that form in water.</li>
                <li>The planet has a cold desert climate, with surface temperatures ranging from -125째C (-195째F) to 20째C (68째F).</li>
                <li>Mars has dust storms that can engulf the entire planet, lasting for weeks or months.</li>
                <li>The thin atmosphere and lack of a global magnetic field make Mars' surface vulnerable to cosmic and solar radiation.</li>
                <li>Mars has polar ice caps made of water ice and dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide).</li>
                <li>NASA has sent several missions to Mars, including rovers like Curiosity, Perseverance, and orbiters like MAVEN.</li>
                <li>The planet's reddish appearance is due to iron oxide, commonly known as rust, on its surface.</li>
                <li>Mars has been a subject of human interest for potential future colonization due to its similarities to Earth.</li>
                <li>The first successful flyby of Mars was by NASA's Mariner 4 in 1965.</li>
                <li>Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, and weather patterns similar to Earth but on a much smaller scale.</li>
                <li>The Martian sky often appears pink or orange due to fine dust particles in the atmosphere.</li>
