            <ul class="facts-list">
                <li>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System after Jupiter.</li>
                <li>It is known for its extensive ring system, composed mostly of ice particles, dust, and small rocky debris.</li>
                <li>Saturn has a diameter of about 116,460 km (72,366 miles), nearly nine times that of Earth.</li>
                <li>Its rings extend up to 282,000 km (175,000 miles) from its center but are only about 20 meters (66 feet) thick.</li>
                <li>The planet is predominantly composed of hydrogen and helium, with a small rocky core.</li>
                <li>Saturn's atmosphere features bands of clouds and a prominent hexagonal storm pattern at its north pole.</li>
                <li>It has at least 82 known moons, with Titan being the largest and notable for its dense atmosphere.</li>
                <li>Saturn has a fast rotational period, completing a day in about 10.7 hours.</li>
                <li>The Cassini-Huygens mission provided extensive data about Saturn, its rings, and moons.</li>
                <li>Its magnetic field is weaker than Jupiter's but still significant, extending beyond the orbit of its largest moon, Titan.</li>
                <li>Saturn's rings are divided into several main groups: A, B, and C rings, with gaps such as the Cassini Division.</li>
                <li>It experiences seasons similar to Earth due to its axial tilt of 26.7 degrees.</li>
                <li>Saturn has a low density, less than water, which means it would float in a giant bathtub if one existed large enough.</li>
                <li>Future missions may explore Saturn's moons for potential habitability and further study its dynamic atmosphere and magnetic environment.</li>
                <li>The planet is visible to the naked eye and has been observed for centuries, with its rings first identified by Galileo in 1610.</li>
                <li>Saturn's rings are dynamic and can change over time due to interactions with its moons and gravitational forces.</li>
                <li>The Voyager and Cassini missions provided detailed images and data about Saturn, revolutionizing our understanding of this gas giant.</li>
