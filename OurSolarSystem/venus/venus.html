            <h2>Venus Facts</h2>
            <ul class="facts-list">
                <li>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth's closest planetary neighbor.</li>
                <li>It's one of the four terrestrial planets, meaning it's a rocky body like Earth.</li>
                <li>Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid.</li>
                <li>Venus's surface temperatures are extremely high, around 465°C (870°F), making it the hottest planet in our Solar System.</li>
                <li>A day on Venus (one rotation) lasts 243 Earth days, and a year (one orbit around the Sun) takes about 225 Earth days.</li>
                <li>Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.</li>
                <li>The atmospheric pressure on Venus's surface is about 92 times that of Earth.</li>
                <li>Venus does not have any moons or rings.</li>
                <li>The planet is named after Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty.</li>
                <li>Venus has a diameter of about 12,104 km (7,521 miles), making it nearly the same size as Earth.</li>
                <li>Venus’s surface is covered with volcanic plains, mountains, and extensive lava flows.</li>
                <li>Due to its thick atmosphere, the planet has a strong greenhouse effect that traps heat.</li>
                <li>Venus has retrograde rotation, which means it rotates backward compared to other planets.</li>
                <li>Venus’s surface is obscured by thick clouds, making it impossible to observe its surface without radar mapping.</li>
                <li>The planet has more volcanoes than any other planet in our Solar System.</li>
                <li>Some areas on Venus may have volcanic activity still occurring today.</li>
                <li>Despite being similar in size to Earth, Venus's surface is very different, with highlands, lowland plains, and large volcanoes.</li>
                <li>Radar mapping has revealed that Venus's surface is relatively young, estimated to be about 300-500 million years old.</li>
                <li>Venus's clouds reflect sunlight, making it one of the brightest objects in our sky.</li>
                <li>The atmospheric composition and surface conditions make it impossible for life as we know it to exist on Venus.</li>
