            <h2>Neptune Facts</h2>
            <ul class="facts-list">
                <li>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the Solar System.</li>
                <li>It is classified as an ice giant, composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and ices like water, ammonia, and methane.</li>
                <li>Neptune has a diameter of about 49,244 km (30,598 miles), making it the fourth-largest planet by diameter and third-largest by mass.</li>
                <li>Its atmosphere is primarily hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of methane, which gives it a blue color.</li>
                <li>Neptune has a system of faint rings and 14 known moons, the largest of which are Triton, Nereid, Naiad, Thalassa, and Despina.</li>
                <li>It has the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the Solar System, with wind speeds reaching up to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph).</li>
                <li>Neptune has a tilted magnetic field, with its magnetic poles offset from its rotational axis by 47 degrees.</li>
                <li>The planet's atmosphere exhibits dynamic weather patterns, including large storms and high-speed jet streams.</li>
                <li>It was discovered in 1846 by Johann Galle and Urbain Le Verrier through mathematical predictions based on irregularities in Uranus' orbit.</li>
                <li>Neptune has a thick atmosphere that consists mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane gas.</li>
                <li>It orbits the Sun once every 164.8 Earth years at an average distance of about 4.5 billion kilometers (30.1 AU).</li>
                <li>Neptune's temperature can drop to -218°C (-360°F), making it one of the coldest places in the Solar System.</li>
                <li>NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune, passing by the planet in 1989 and providing detailed images and data.</li>
                <li>Neptune's blue color comes from methane in its atmosphere absorbing red light and reflecting blue.</li>
                <li>Scientists believe Neptune has a rocky core surrounded by a deep layer of ice and a thick atmosphere of gases.</li>
                <li>Future missions may explore Neptune further to study its moons, rings, and complex weather systems.</li>
                <li>Neptune is not visible to the naked eye and requires a telescope to observe.</li>
                <li>Its moon Triton has geysers that eject nitrogen gas and dust particles into space.</li>
